The purpose of this document is to serve as a "living" supplement to the first paper on the SPARTYN pipeline. While the paper itself will be static upon publication, this document will serve as both an ongoing supplement as well as a central location to give updated, detailed information on the pipeline and methods. 

If you have a question that is not adequately addressed in this supplement, please email oshern (at) umich.edu.
