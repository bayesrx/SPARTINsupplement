<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>Raw data was obtained for this project using the image
processing tools of Rao and Krishnan. A random forest model was
trained on high definition images of cancer biopsies in order
to automatically classify cells of different types. Images of
Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) biopsies from The Cancer Genome Atlas
program were processed using this model such that
each cell was classified as a tumor cell, a lymphocyte, or
other. In addition, the x- and y-coordinates of each cell
centroid (relative to the pathology slide) were determined and
recorded. The resulting data set for each biopsy consisted of a
row for each cell, with a column for the x-coordinate, a column
for the y-coordinate, and an indicator of the cell type. Each
biopsy was intensity thresholded to define a “fitted” window, i.e.
the smallest window that fit all cells in the biopsy within it.
This window was then divided into tiles that fully partition it,
while containing similar numbers of tumor cells. A bayesian spatial
point process model was then fit on each of these tiles separately,
yielding a posterior distribution of the local interaction parameter.
For each tile, this local distribution was then compared to a
tile-specific null distribution, before being combined to summarize
the overall level of interaction at the biopsy level.</p>
<p>SKCM is an appealing target for the investigation of lymphocyte
infiltration for several reasons. SKCM has been shown to be
particularly responsive to Immunotherapy in some cases [CITATION].
It is possible that the ability to quantify lymphocyte
infiltration at a large scale may allow for more detailed
investigation into the scenarios in which this treatment may be
most effectively deployed. What’s more, SKCM has an unusually
high mutational load amongst the various cancer types [CITATION].
The ability to quantify infiltration may allow for further
investigation into not only genomic associations of this
occurrence but associations with mutations as well. [TODO:
is infiltration particularly common in SKCM? I feel like it is,
but I need to verify this.]</p>

<p>Denote the number of biopsies <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and for biopsy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>

Within each patient, this data can be naturally thought
of as a marked point process and modeled as such.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided to use a Hierachical
Multitype Strauss Model for our data, the density of which is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2) \propto 
\beta_1^{n_1} \beta_2^{n_2}
\gamma_{11}^{S_{R_{11}}(\mathbf{p}_1)}
\gamma_{22}^{S_{R_{2}}(\mathbf{p}_2)}
\gamma_{12}^{S_{R_{12}}(\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2)}
\quad (1)\]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>We decided to use this model over the standard Multitype Strauss
model for two reasons.
Firstly, treating the locations of the lymphocytes as conditional
upon the locations of the tumor cells is a priori biologically
plausible. Secondly, the hierarchical variant of the Strauss
model allows for the proper modeling of positive interaction
between points of different types, while the standard
multitype model does not. Note that because intra-type
interaction is still confined to be negative under the
Hierarchical Multitype Strauss Process, we constrained the
intra-type interaction parameters <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{11}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{22}\)</span>
to be 1. Finally, based on prior biological knowledge, we set
<span class="math inline">\(R_{12} = 30\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span>. In our context, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{12}\)</span> can be
thought of as the degree to which lymphocytes to be close to or
far away from tumor cells, conditional upon the locations
of the tumor cells. This allows us to distinguish between the<br />
mere relative abundance of different cell types (which is<br />
captured by the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> parameters) and the
actual spatial associations between the different cell types.</p>

<div id="intensity-thresholding-and-partition-1" class="section level2" number="7.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Intensity Thresholding and Partition</h2>
<p>Each biopsy was partitioned into non-overlapping sub-regions,
each of which was modeled as a point process. The primary
motivation for structuring the analysis this came from prior
biological knowledge about tumor composition. Tumors are
heterogeneous entities in many respects, and lymphocyte infiltration
is no exception. Thus, partitioning the biopsy into non-
overlapping sub-regions and fitting models on each sub-region is
a natural way to capture this heterogeneity. This strategy has additional benefits in that it allows for the parallelization of
model fitting across the resulting sub-regions within a single
biopsy.</p>
<p>In order to partition a given biopsy into non-overlapping
sub-regions, we beganwith the smallest bounding rectangular
window that contained cells <span class="math inline">\(1...c_i\)</span>, we applied an intensity thresholding algorithm [too much?] in order to find the smallest
possible window that still contained all <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> cells. Next, we
applied a voronoi tesselation to the <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> tumor cells within the intensity thresholded window, partitioning it into tumor cell<br />
specific sub-windows <span class="math inline">\(1...T_i\)</span> corresponding to tumor cells<br />
<span class="math inline">\(1...T_i\)</span>. We then applied a modified version of k-means to<br />
tumor cells <span class="math inline">\(1...T_i\)</span>,such that each of the <span class="math inline">\(K_i\)</span> resulting<br />
clusters was constrained to be between a pre-defined range of<br />
cell counts. Finally, each tumor cell specific sub-window within
a given cluster was combined into a tile, corresponding to each
of the <span class="math inline">\(K_i\)</span> clusters from the k-means clustering. This results
in <span class="math inline">\(K_i\)</span> tiles that fully partition the intensity thresholded
window. This partition uniquely defines the membership of each of
the <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> total cells into one of the resulting <span class="math inline">\(K_i\)</span> total tiles.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that there is nothing particularly unique
about this method of partitioning the biopsy. Any other method could
be used in its place, so long as the result is a partition of the
biopsy into some number of non-overlapping sub-regions on which the
subsequent model fitting can proceed.</p>

<div id="inference-1" class="section level2" number="7.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Inference</h2>
<p>In order to compute posterior distributions of parameters of
interest, we used Bayesian techniques in the style of King et al.
2012. This methodology essentially exchanges the likelihood
function used in standard Bayesian inference for the
pseudolikelihood function (Besag, 1975 [VERIFY]), with the
integral approximated via the Berman-Turner device (Baddeley
and Turner, 2000) using the spatstat package (Baddeley and Turner,
2005). Finally, each parameter estimated (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{12}\)</span>) was assigned a flat prior. [TODO: Technically,
normal with mean 0 and variance <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span> because of limitations
of JAGS- should I spell this out?] Posterior distributions were
computed using MCMC via the R2jags package (Su, 2015). Using
these techniques we were able to compute a
posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik | \mathbf{p}}(y)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{ik,12}\)</span> for
each for each biopsy <span class="math inline">\(i \in \{1...n\}\)</span> and tile
<span class="math inline">\(k \in \{1...K_i\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="infiltration-probability-1" class="section level2" number="7.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Infiltration Probability</h2>
<p>In order to compute a localized probability of infiltration, each
posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik | \mathbf{p}}(y)\)</span> was compared to a
tile specific null distribution, <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik, 0}(y)\)</span>.
Because under null interaction (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{ik, 12} = 1)\)</span>) our
model reduces to two independent Poisson processes with
intensities <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1, \beta_2\)</span>, this was accomplished by
treating the observed tumor cells as fixed, simulating <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
realizations of lymphocytes under a Poisson process with the
observed intensity, performing the previously described model
fitting procedure on each, and aggregating samples across
simulation <span class="math inline">\(1...s\)</span>. Under the assumption that the posterior
distribution <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik | \mathbf{p}}(x)\)</span> is independent from the null
distribution <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik, 0}(y)\)</span>, we then computed the tile specific
Infiltration Probability <span class="math inline">\(r_{ik}\)</span>, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{ik} = \int \int  I(x &gt; y) f_{ik | \mathbf{p}}(x) f_{ik, 0}(y)  dxdy \qquad (2)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(r_{ik} \in [0, 1]\)</span>, and can be naturally interpreted
as the posterior probability of positive interaction.</p>
