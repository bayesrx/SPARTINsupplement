Due to the limitations of direct measurement methods, computational algorithms are often used to infer immune cell composition from bulk tumor transcriptome proﬁles. These estimated tumor immune inﬁltrate populations have been associated with genomic and transcriptomic changes in the tumors, providing insight into tumor–immune interactions. However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor–immune interactions, we signiﬁcantly improved our previous web platform TIMER. Instead of just using one algorithm, TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/) provides more robust estimation of immune inﬁltration levels for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or user-provided tumor proﬁles using six state-of-the-art algorithms. TIMER2.0 provides four modules for investigating the associations between immune inﬁltrates and genetic or clinical features, and four modules for exploring cancer-related associations in the TCGA cohorts. Each module can generate a functional heatmap table, enabling the user to easily identify signiﬁcant associations in multiple cancer types simultaneously. Overall, the TIMER2.0 web server provides comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of tumor inﬁltrating immune cells.}, number={W1}, journal={Nucleic Acids Research}, author={Li, Taiwen and Fu, Jingxin and Zeng, Zexian and Cohen, David and Li, Jing and Chen, Qianming and Li, Bo and Liu, X Shirley}, year={2020}, month={Jul}, pages={W509–W514}, language={en} }

Virtually all the major principles of “tumor immunology” have been experimentally established in this model. It is now amply clear that melanoma cells display multiple antigens and peptide epitopes that are targetable by the host immune system and that patients with melanoma are capable of responding to these antigens and epitopes serologically as well as through the cell-mediated mechanisms. The immune responses against melanoma are, however, subject to regulation by the regulatory processes within the immune system itself and melanoma cells can resort to overt evasive activities. Indeed, the intrinsic as well as the extrinsic mechanisms within the immune system that are designed to control the magnitude as well as the duration of immune responses at times act as constraints against generating a robust and long-lasting antimelanoma response and melanoma cells are capable of using all the tricks (eg, downregulation of targetable molecules, elaboration of immunosuppressive cytokines) available to living organisms so as to evade immune recognition and destruction. As a result, the immune system often fails to protect the host against melanoma development and progression. The cumulative knowledge over the years on melanoma-associated antigens and epitopes, on methods of immunization, and on technologies for generating melanoma antigen-specific T cells, natural or engineered, have led to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies with “melanoma vaccines” and with T-cell–based adoptive immunotherapy for melanoma. Although these strategies have not been uniformly successful in all cases, durable complete regressions of metastatic melanoma can at times be obtained with active specific immunization or adoptive cell therapy. There is reason for hope that continued research in the field is likely to improve the outcome of melanoma immunotherapy: the ultimate goal of tumor immunology.}, number={2}, journal={Clinics in Dermatology}, author={Mukherji, Bijay}, year={2013}, month={Mar}, pages={156–165}, language={en} }

 @article{Oble09, title={Focus on TILs: Prognostic significance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in human melanoma}, volume={9}, abstractNote={Tumors contain variable numbers of lymphocytes, referred to as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In melanoma, the intensity of this lymphocytic infiltrate is believed to correlate with outcome, though there is some debate about the applicability of this finding for all melanomas. Much research has gone into classifying TILs with respect to antigen receptor structure and the antigen to which melanoma-specific T cells react. However, these studies for the most part did not immunophenotype TILs, and recent data has revealed that the composition of tumoral lymphocytes is not homogenous, but rather represents varying contributions from many lymphocytic subsets. Furthermore, the function of TILs is often compromised as a result of the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells and various tumor escape mechanisms. These recent insights stress the need to collect more data on the composition and function of TIL infiltrates before definitive conclusions about the prognostic significance of TILs can be drawn. Advances in immunology have also facilitated the development of immunotherapeutic strategies, examples of which will be discussed with a special emphasis on blocking antibodies against CTLA-4, which are prototypical immunotherapeutic agents. This flurry of novel “biological” therapies will undoubtedly complicate our already incomplete understanding of TIL immunobiology as each of these agents has the potential to uniquely distort the series of immunological events which normally occur in untreated melanoma. Therefore, considerable research is needed to better elucidate the function and prognostic significance of TILs in both untreated melanoma and tumors treated with “biological” therapy.}, journal={Cancer Immunity}, author={Oble, Darryl A. and Loewe, Robert and Yu, Ping and Mihm Jr., Martin C.}, year={2009}, pages={20}, language={en} }

 title={Expansion and Characterization of Human Melanoma Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs)}, volume={5}, ISSN={1932-6203}, DOI={10.1371/journal.pone.0013940}, abstractNote={Background: Various immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer are aimed at augmenting the T cell response against tumor cells. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where T cells are manipulated ex vivo and subsequently re-infused in an autologous manner, has been performed using T cells from various sources. Some of the highest clinical response rates for metastatic melanoma have been reported in trials using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These protocols still have room for improvement and furthermore are currently only performed at a limited number of institutions. The goal of this work was to develop TILs as a therapeutic product at our institution.}, number={11}, journal={PLoS ONE}, author={Nguyen, Linh T. and Yen, Pei Hua and Nie, Jessica and Liadis, Nicole and Ghazarian, Danny and Al-Habeeb, Ayman and Easson, Alexandra and Leong, Wey and Lipa, Joan and McCready, David and Reedijk, Michael and Hogg, David and Joshua, Anthony M. and Quirt, Ian and Messner, Hans and Shaw, Patricia and Crump, Michael and Sharon, Eran and Ohashi, Pamela S.}, editor={Unutmaz, Derya}, year={2010}, month={Nov}, pages={e13940}, language={en} }
