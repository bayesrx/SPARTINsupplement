In the tumor microenvironment neoplastic cells shape the diﬀerentiation and functional orientation of TAM which, in turn, express several protumoral functions, including secretion of growth factors and matrix-proteases, promotion of angiogenesis and suppression of adaptive immunity. This review analyzes our current knowledge of TAM and their involvement in tumor development and progression. The interplay between TAM and neoplastic cells represents a promising target of future therapeutic approaches.},

Due to the limitations of direct measurement methods, computational algorithms are often used to infer immune cell composition from bulk tumor transcriptome proﬁles. These estimated tumor immune inﬁltrate populations have been associated with genomic and transcriptomic changes in the tumors, providing insight into tumor–immune interactions. However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor–immune interactions, we signiﬁcantly improved our previous web platform TIMER. Instead of just using one algorithm, TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/) provides more robust estimation of immune inﬁltration levels for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or user-provided tumor proﬁles using six state-of-the-art algorithms. TIMER2.0 provides four modules for investigating the associations between immune inﬁltrates and genetic or clinical features, and four modules for exploring cancer-related associations in the TCGA cohorts. Each module can generate a functional heatmap table, enabling the user to easily identify signiﬁcant associations in multiple cancer types simultaneously. Overall, the TIMER2.0 web server provides comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of tumor inﬁltrating immune cells.}, number={W1}, journal={Nucleic Acids Research}, author={Li, Taiwen and Fu, Jingxin and Zeng, Zexian and Cohen, David and Li, Jing and Chen, Qianming and Li, Bo and Liu, X Shirley}, year={2020}, month={Jul}, pages={W509–W514}, language={en} }
